# Document Classification
 
The classify.py script attempts to classify documents as either from 2016 or 2020. I am reading in a corpus (a collection of documents) with two possible labels and training a classifier to determine which label a query document is more likely to have.

Here's the twist: the corpus is created from CS 540 essays about AI100 from 2016 and 2020 on the same topic. Based on training data from each, I'll attempt to predict whether an essay was written in 2020 or 2016.
